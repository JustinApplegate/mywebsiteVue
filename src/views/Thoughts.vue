            <p class="question">What are your greatest strengths?</p>
            <p class="answer">My greatest strengths are probably an attention to detail, being a natural leader,
                and a quick learner.</p>

            <p class="question">What is your greatest professional achievement?</p>
            <p class="answer">My greatest professional achievement has been getting my last job working for
                BYU's Dept of Continuing Education Quality Assurance Team. Despite this being my first semester
                in college, I was able to land a well-paying job that allows me to grow my technical skills.</p>

            <p class="question">Tell me one lesson you've learned from life.</p>
            <p class="answer">I served a two-year mission in Houston, Texas as a Spanish-speaking missionary. My 
                time as a missionary has taught me to work hard regardless of any obstacles in my way. There were 
                lots of people that I contacted who were not interested in my message, but I knew that I needed 
                to keep pushing forward.</p>
